        Svetlana has got higher education in Music and Teaching. It means that
        music sounds in our Home most of the time when she is in! Svetlana has
        been working with children every day for 20 years - at first it was in
        development centres for children, then she was working for a long time
        as the Head of year-round health improvement camp for children. And now,
        every day she brings activity, joy and the feeling of stability to our
        children in the form of a game.


        "Why particularly children became a bigger part of my life?" - Because
        they are always true. It would be great if it were possible to remain
        like this forever.  I am the person for whom nothing is impossible, I
        try to see the best sides in everything.  Every morning I start with the
        motto: "Everything is in my hands!!!"

        I graduated from the Spanish Department of the Faculty of Foreign
        Languages in the Russian State Pedagogical University n.a. A.I. Herzen
        in 2002. I have been teaching Spanish to little ones and adults since
        2000. I believe that learning a foreign language must be accompanied by
        the feeling of freedom and pleasure, it refers to any foreign language,
        but especially to Spanish  - one of the most beautiful languages in the
        world, which is native for a huge number of people.


        Language classes with children is a special pleasure. You become wiser
        and more patient when dealing with these responsive, thankful and
        straightforward pupils.
